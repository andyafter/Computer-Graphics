  abstract = {The goal of the thesis is to implement and describe the implementation
	of one solution for capturing the correct appearence of light's complex
	behavior in translucent materials. The thesis focuses on real-time
	performance: a quality that physically based solutions do not offer.
	Related literature study has helped to shape a solution that combines
	previous works. Still, the solution detaches itself from the previous
	ones due to different interpretations and the aim was to develop
	a more robust algorithm. The implementation for the chosen solution
	takes full advantage of the modern graphics processing unit's programmable
	pipeline and uses programming procedures known as point splatting,
	texture space sampling, environment map filtering and deferred rendering.
	The underlying theory comes from radiometry, diffusion approximation
	and numerical integration. To reach real-time performance, a trade-off
	has been made and light-geometry interaction has been limited to
	account only for single-bounce and multiple scattering events inside
	the medium. The renderings obtained are visually pleasing, they capture
	the appearence of the materials they depict and they match (to a
	degree set by the above mentioned trade-off) their corresponding
	off-line renderings.},
